# Ping Pong but it's Pong

A classic game of Pong or smth like that idk.

The first one to get 10 points win.
Name your player - Player 1 & Player 2 can choose any name they want.

Player 1: w to up, s to down (Make sure CAPS LOCK is off).
Player 2: i to up, j to down (Make sure CAPS LOCK is off).

Very simple but very fun to learn. Enjoy!
